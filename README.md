# Room-Light
The RGB controller for my Room


The code consists of an effect.ino file with all the effect functions.
Each function gets a Adafruit_NeoPixel leds[] array passed so you can access all led items.
In the main.ino the effects can be called. 
There is also a 3.5mm input jack which goes to two analog inputs.
Those are for music-reactive effects.
